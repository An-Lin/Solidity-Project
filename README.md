Steps remaining in version 1
1. Timeout on games for withdrawing funds ( So they aren't stuck )
2. Front End
	A. Play -> wait - > Reveal
	B. Reveal -> wait -> Winner/Loser
	C. Winner/Loser -> Re-Play


Ideas for version 2

1. Multi game session
	- sidebar with active games
2. Game history page with result
3. A deposite function (maybe the user just want to deposit first, right now the only way to deposite is to play)
4. Able to challenge friend with address
5. Player able to set amount to wagerr (auto match player with same amount)
